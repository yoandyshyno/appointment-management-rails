        <h2>Do-it-yourself: Appointment Management</h2>
        Users should be able to register with the system. For each registered user, the system stores the
name and an email address, and maintains a calendar. A calendar is a list of appointments for
a certain user. Appointments have a start time (and date) and an end time and date, a title,
potentially some additional, textual notes, and can be of one of the following types: Blocked,
Free, Potentially Blocked, Away. Additionally, appointments can be marked as private, which
means they will not be made visible to other users under any circumstances. Users—once logged into
the system—can add appointments to their own calendar. When doing so, they may request that
the appointment be placed into another user’s calendar, too—typically because they are scheduling
a meeting with this user. In such a case, the system shall check for conﬂicts with that user’s
appointments. If there are no conﬂicts, it should add the appointment to both users’ calendars.
Otherwise, it should inform the user of the conﬂict, and, if the conﬂicting appointment is not
private, inform the user of the conﬂicting appointment. Two appointments are in conﬂict, if they
2overlap in time, and none of the two appointments is of type Free. Of course, the system should
also check for conﬂicting appointments in the user’s own calendar.
Additionally, each registered user should be able to view his or her appointments for the current
day.
